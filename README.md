<h2 align="left"> Abstract </h2>

<p align="justify">
Test smells represent a set of poorly designed tests, which can harm test code maintenance. Although fundamental steps have been taken to understand test smells, there is still an evident lack of studies on teaching the practice of refactoring test smells. This paper presents an experience report in teaching test smells refactoring with 30 students from the Software Engineering course's Software Quality and Software Maintenance classes. We investigated: (i) the main skills acquired by students during the refactoring of test smells and (ii) the difficulty of refactoring these test smells by students. Our findings highlight the benefits of teaching test smells refactoring and a methodology for teaching these concepts in practice.
